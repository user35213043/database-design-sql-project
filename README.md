Oracle SQL and MongoDB implementation for the Ocean Odyssey cruise booking database.

## Overview

This project demonstrates database design, querying, and data modelling techniques
using both relational and document-based approaches. It was developed as part of a
university database systems unit and focuses on comparing SQL-based and NoSQL-based
solutions for the same problem domain.

Key concepts demonstrated include:
- Advanced SQL querying using Oracle
- Schema design, evolution, and integrity constraints
- JSON generation from a relational database
- NoSQL document modelling and updates using MongoDB
- Comparison of relational vs document-based database approaches

## Technologies Used

- Oracle SQL / PL-SQL
- MongoDB
- MongoDB for VS Code
